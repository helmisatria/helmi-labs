# Helmi Labs

Welcome to my personal laboratory! This repository serves as a playground for my technical explorations and experiments with various web technologies. Here, I document my journey of learning and building interesting features that I'm curious about.

## Current Experiment: Face Recognition & Expression Detection

My current exploration focuses on implementing face recognition and expression detection in web applications. I was curious about how to leverage machine learning capabilities directly in the browser, which led me to experiment with face-api.js and TensorFlow.js.

### What I'm Learning

- How to process real-time video streams in the browser
- Implementation of machine learning models in client-side JavaScript
- Face detection and expression analysis using neural networks
- Privacy-focused approaches to sensitive data processing

### Features Built So Far

- Real-time face detection
- Facial expression recognition
- Face landmark detection

## Tech Stack & Libraries Used

- React
- TypeScript
- face-api.js & TensorFlow.js
- Vite + Vike
- Tailwind CSS
- Tanstack Query
